                        represents someone at the royal residence.  Each card 
                        has a value in the upper left corner—the higher the 
                        number, the closer that person is to the princess. At the
                        bottom of each card, a text box describes the effect

                        <h6 class="col-12">Shuffle the 16 cards to form a face-down draw deck. 
                        Remove the top card of the deck from the game without 
                        looking at it. If you are playing a two-player game, take 
                        three more cards from the top of the deck and place 
                        them to the side, face up. They will not be used during 
                        this round. Each player draws one card from the deck.
                        This is the player’s hand, and is kept secret from the 
                        others. Whoever was most recently on a date goes first
                        (if tied, the younger player wins the tie).</h6>

                        <h6 class="col-12">Love Letter is played in a series of rounds. Each round 
                        represents one day. At the end of each round, one 
                        player’s letter reaches Princess, and she reads it. When 
                        she reads enough letters from one suitor, she becomes
                        enamored and grants that suitor permission to court 
                        her. That player wins the princess’s heart and the 
                        game. </h6>


                        <h1 class="col-12">Taking a Turn</h1>

                        <h6 class="col-12">On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add 
                        it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in 
                        your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply
                        any effect on the card you discarded. You must apply 
                        its effect, even if it is bad for you. All discarded cards 
                        remain in front of the player who discarded them.
                        Overlap the cards so that it’s clear in which order they
                        were discarded. This helps players to figure out which 
                        cards other players might be holding. Once you finish 
                        applying the card’s effect, the turn passes to the player
                        on your left.</h6>


                        <h1 class="col-12">End of a Round </h1>

                        <h6 class="col-12">A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a turn. 
                        The royal residence closes for the evening, the person 
                        closest to the princess delivers the love letter, and 
                        Princess retires to her chambers to read it. All players 
                        still in the round reveal their hands. The player with the
                        highest ranked person wins the round. In case of a tie, 
                        the player who discarded the highest total value of 
                        cards wins. A round also ends if all players but one are 
                        out of the round, in which case the remaining player 
                        wins. </h6>

                        <h6 class="col-12">The winner receives a token of affection. Shuffle all 16 
                        cards together, and play a new round following all of 
                        the setup rules. The winner of the previous round goes 
                        first, because the princess speaks kindly of him or her 
                        at breakfast. </h6>
